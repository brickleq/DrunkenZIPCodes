# DrunkenZIPCodes
## ETL Project

In this project we use Pandas, SQLAlchemy, and MySQL to merge CSV data from [data.world](https://data.world/dcopendata/liquor-licenses) with API data from [the U.S. Census](https://github.com/CommerceDataService/census-wrapper), and determine the count of licensed bars in each ZIP code.
